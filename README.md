# Retail-Sales-Analysis-with-Python(EDA)

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset. The goal was to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance using visualizations and basic analysis techniques.

##  About the Dataset

The dataset includes:
-  dates
- Product categories
- Customer age and gender
- Quantity and total amount of purchase

It gives a good mix of customer and sales data for analysis.

## 🔍 What I Did

Here's a quick breakdown of the steps I followed:

- Cleaned and prepared the data
- Analyzed sales trends weekly and monthly
- Checked which product categories perform best
- Looked at customer age groups and their buying patterns
- Compared gender-wise customer count
- Used a heatmap to see what different age groups prefer
- Plotted how quantity and total sales are related
- Based on the analysis, shared a few business-friendly recommendations at the end

## 📊 Key Insights

- **May had the highest sales**, especially in the 2nd and 3rd weeks.
- **Electronics** was the top-selling product category.
- The **41–60 age group** spent the most overall.
- **Females slightly outnumbered males** in the customer base.
- Different age groups showed different product preferences.
